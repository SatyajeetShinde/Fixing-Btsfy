# Contributing to Btsfy

- Btsfy is an application that allows you to chunk JSON and CSV files, convert JSON to CSV and vice versa, and save and download files from your dashboard.
- This application is built with Django , as a final project for one of my courses
- Due to deadlines and time constraints, I was not able to implement all the features I wanted to implement, so I decided to open source it, so that anyone can contribute to it.
- Here are some of the problems I'd like help with:

1. Implementing a better UI:

- I'm not a designer, so I'm not good at designing a good UI, so I'd like help with redesigning the interface for csv and json chunking.

2. Implementing a better file upload system:

- I'm currently using the default file upload system provided by Django, but I'd like to implement a better file upload system, that allows users to upload files from their local machine, and also allows them to upload files from a URL.

3. Implementing a better file download system:

- The download system is slow, and might not work for large files, so I'd like help with implementing a better download system.

4. Reducing the amount of html code in the templates:

- Due to the need for every member to contribute, there's a lot of unnecessary html code in the templates, so I'd like help with reducing the amount and complexity of the html code in the templates.
